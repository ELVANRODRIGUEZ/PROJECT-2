# TEAM ORGANIZER

## DESCRIPTION

This is a web app that will manage tasks within workteams in such a way that it conveys to each member his/her own contributions to one or several projects. The projoct has the following considerations:

* It is like the anteroom for a Project Management, in which the team(s) can start outlining the Work Breakdown Structure of the projects and start defining tasks, scopes, responsibles, temptative timelines, etc.

* It will have an "Statistics" page to show in infographs the project(s) development. This might imply the usage of graphs API's.

* For now, the program will run in "sessions" so there will be teammates accounts and will be thought for just one workgroup.

* There will be an internal chat that will externalized through mail API's to extend comunications.
